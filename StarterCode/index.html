          <h2>Relationships between Poverty and Lack of Access to Healthcare</h2>
          <p>The results show an interesting relationship between a State's percentage of population that is classified as in poverty as compared 
            to the access to healthcare.  The State with the highest degree of access to healthcare as expected, was Massachusetts which passed
            legislation guaranteeing universal healthcare access.  However, it's interesting to note that even in Massachusetts, over 4.5% of the 
            population still lacks access to healthcare, so availability doesn't necessairly correlate with usage or delivery.</p>

          <p>For the most part, Southeastern U.S. States, including Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas, Louisana and Mississippi and West Virginia made up 
            the States with the highest degree of poverty, but the percentage of their populations that lacked access to healthcare still varied widely, 
            from Kentucky at 10% to Lousisana at 19%.</p>
            
          <p>Texas and Georgia sttod out in thier high degrees of poverty and lack of access to healthcare.  Northeast States, inlcuding New Hampshire, 
            Maryland, Connecticut and New Jersey, joined by Wyoming, had the lowest degree of poverty, but lack of access to healthcare still variend 
            from about 9% to more than 15%.  Clearly these are complex issues and many other factors are driving the results.</p>
